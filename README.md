# graphics
This is a Java-based OpenGL graphics engine initially written for use for a Computer Animation class at the Rochester Institute of Technology taught by Professor Joe Geigel.

The library was initially created for mostly 2D animation algorithms but was updated to handle a 3D Scene/Camera setup. It has code for bounding volumes, colors, vector math, matrix math, and renderable objects. It also has abstractions for textures, shaders, vertex buffers, models, and timing/animation utilities.
